# Bug Analysis Report

## Critical Issues

### 1. API Key Security Vulnerability
- **Issue**: API key is obfuscated in `script_top.js` but still client-side accessible
- **Risk**: High - API key can be extracted by determined users
- **Impact**: Potential API abuse and billing issues

### 2. Incomplete Settings Implementation
- **Issue**: Level selector (`selectedLevel`) doesn't affect AI prompts or card difficulty
- **Location**: Lines 673-677 in settings modal, used only for emoji display
- **Impact**: User expects difficulty to affect content generation

### 3. Mobile Touch Target Issues
- **Issue**: Some buttons are smaller than 44px minimum touch target
- **Locations**: TTS buttons (28px), pronunciation buttons (32px)
- **Impact**: Poor mobile usability

### 4. Infinite Scroll Performance
- **Issue**: Multiple scroll event listeners without proper cleanup
- **Locations**: Lines 1011-1012, window and cardList both listening
- **Impact**: Potential memory leaks and performance degradation

### 5. Error State Management
- **Issue**: Limited error recovery and user feedback
- **Impact**: Poor user experience when API fails or network issues occur

## Minor Issues

### 1. Accessibility Gaps
- Missing ARIA labels for dynamic content
- No keyboard navigation for cards
- Screen reader support incomplete

### 2. CSS Inconsistencies
- Mixed CSS methodologies (inline styles vs classes)
- Hardcoded colors instead of CSS custom properties
- Responsive breakpoints could be optimized

### 3. Code Organization
- Large single file with mixed concerns
- No module separation
- Inline event handlers mixed with addEventListener calls

## Performance Issues

### 1. Unoptimized Scroll Handling
- Multiple scroll listeners active simultaneously
- No throttling on some scroll events
- Potential for excessive DOM queries

### 2. Memory Management
- Chat history grows indefinitely
- No cleanup of event listeners
- Potential memory leaks in long sessions

### 3. API Request Optimization
- No request caching
- No request deduplication
- No offline queue for failed requests
